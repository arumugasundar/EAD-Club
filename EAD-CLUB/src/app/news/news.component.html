        <blockquote>
          As a result, three Spaniards joined Chelsea in 2011 and the trio were all part of the squad which won the Champions League for the first time the next year. Juan Mata was probably the most prominent of them, providing the Bluesâ€™ creative spark in the middle of the park. He was unlucky to see his penalty saved by Manuel Neuer in the shoot-out against Bayern in Munich, but his contribution to that success, and others, was rightly recognised as he was named Chelsea Player of the Year in both his full seasons here.

          Fernando Torres, who arrived around six months before Mata, never managed to hit the heights he had reached earlier in his career with Liverpool and the Spanish national team, but still played a significant role in that triumph, coming off the bench in the final. Indeed, many of his best performances in a Blues shirt came in continental competition, as he scored the opener in our 2013 Europa League final victory and his nine European goals that season were a club record until they was surpassed by Olivier Giroud last year.
